    "### ConvLSTM\n",
    "<a href='https://medium.com/neuronio/an-introduction-to-convlstm-55c9025563a7' >ConvLSTM</a> is a neural network which combines the architectures of Convolutional (Conv) operations and Long short-term memory (LSTM). The purpose with this technique is to deal with images sequentially. For this project, ConvLSTM will be applied to predict the next 5 frames. So, given 5 frames predict the next 5 frames.\n",

    "\\\n",
    "ConvLSTM is simply an architecture which contains recurrent layers to operate on each image sequantially. The difference between the original RNN is that the matrix multiplication is replaced with convolutions. \n",
